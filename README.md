Interactive Photo Gallery
An interactive photo gallery crafted using jQuery. I created my own code for the a searchable gallery that allows the photos to hide and show depending on user input. Using jQuery and the  Lightbox 2 plugin a photo will display in a lightbox when the user clicks on a thumbnail image. # Tech_Degree_Project_5
